# bitcloutgold

Bitclout Gold is an experimental service to provide a subscription layer over the top of bitclout.

The creator's will be able to set a minimum coin count for viewers to view their gold content.  Encouraging bitclout followers to invest in content creation.

It is currently being tested in a small alpha. It works simialiar to bitcoinpulse adding a new UI over the node. But with authentication on followers who must own coins.

## What is this site

This site will be preview for bitcloudgold as we launch. Right now it's under construction.

## Open Source

All of bitcloutgold will be open source when it is fully launched. You will be able to run your own nodes and even fork to bitcloutsilver if you want!!!
